Notes for changes from uses of these tools in practical application and day-to-day use.
-----------------------------------------------------

RenamerLibrary:
---------------
- Still has issues with renaming on repeat objects, not causing long-name issues.  Do tests before finalizing anything else.
- Suffix adding only affects first selection?

CurveAssignment:
----------------
- Widget forces a selected = cmds.ls(sl=True)[0] when nothing might be selected.  Change to a try/except that leaves selected = None if it fails.
- Widget does not create unique controller when Create Control is clicked, forces a selection
- Widget hierarchy list of offsets needs an 'X' button to remove unwanted parts.
  - Also seems to be mostly broken, performing the operation 3 times? (might be related to number of hierarchy groups)
- Widget correctly snaps to selection, but does not iterate over full list if more than one object is selected.
- Widget should have an overrideName checkbox as an option.
- New Curve types:
  - double/2-sided arrow

AttributeManipulation:
----------------------
- min/max values should be open to accepting None values.  Skip incorrect conditions in function, accept noneTypes in class.



NOTES ADDRESSED ON 12/18/2018:
------------------------------

RenamerLibrary:
---------------
- Fails on all counts to change names if there is a duplicate name anywhere in the scene.  Probably needs to evaluate based on long names (cmds.ls(long=True)).
- Regex for find/replace does not accept numbers, enough application suggests it should take them.
- Suffix remove (and like prefix and other related bits) will repeat iterate when removing a suffix.  (ie. '*_CND_CND' becomes '*').  Try changing it to using .endswith('<input>') instead and see if that doesn't over iterate the issue.


CurveAssignment:
----------------
- Assign color on the tooldock (and likely general calls) only assigns color to the first selected object.  Should take all selected.
- Despite previous debate, orange preset in dock is too far to a red-orange.  Refer to the old curve tool for orange values, but keep red-orange in library as its distinction is still appealing and stands out.
- Assign color on the tooldock (and likely general calls) fails if the shortname of a shape node is not unique in the scene.  Likely needs a similar fix as the renamerLibrary longname fixes.


AttributeManipulation:
----------------------
- dock attr creator should have an option for keyable/non-keyable attributes (checkbox).
- dock attr creator does not have a bool attribute option.
- dock attr fails if nothing is put in the min/max boxes.  Reads as '' when it only takes int or None.  Needs fix in function and set the values in the Widget to "try" methods excepting ValueErrors.
- dock attr creator should have a clear index options button for the enum setup.


NodeLibrary(?):
---------------
- Build some matrix setups?  Immediate helper would involve a matrix setup that can cleanly setup space switches (fuck constraints).
  - Account for controller scaling and double transforms when using world/local values mixed with positions to avoid double transforms
    - Will require parent/world inverse matrices (similar to constraints without logic cycles)
- Change node_dictionary clamp node input to 'CLMP', otherwise node_name_dictionary will give it the wrong argument.
- Add multMatrix to library


FingerRigTool:
--------------
- Some of the MDIV nodes in the finger offset only take one input, should be converted to MDL nodes.
