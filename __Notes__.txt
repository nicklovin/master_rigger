Notes for changes from uses of these tools in practical application and day-to-day use.
-----------------------------------------------------

RenamerLibrary:
---------------
- Fails on all counts to change names if there is a duplicate name anywhere in the scene.  Probably needs to evaluate based on long names (cmds.ls(long=True)).
- Regex for find/replace does not accept numbers, enough application suggests it should take them.
- Suffix remove (and like prefix and other related bits) will repeat iterate when removing a suffix.  (ie. '*_CND_CND' becomes '*').  Try changing it to using .endswith('<input>') instead and see if that doesn't over iterate the issue.


CurveAssignment:
----------------
- Assign color on the tooldock (and likely general calls) only assigns color to the first selected object.  Should take all selected.
- Despite previous debate, orange preset in dock is too far to a red-orange.  Refer to the old curve tool for orange values, but keep red-orange in library as its distinction is still appealing and stands out.


AttributeManipulation:
----------------------
- dock attr creator should have an option for keyable/non-keyable attributes (checkbox).
- dock attr creator does not have a bool attribute option.
- dock attr fails if nothing is put in the min/max boxes.  Reads as '' when it only takes int or None.  Needs fix in function and set the values in the Widget to "try" methods excepting ValueErrors.


NodeLibrary(?):
---------------
- Build some matrix setups?  Immediate helper would involve a matrix setup that can cleanly setup space switches (fuck constraints).


FingerRigTool:
--------------
- Some of the MDIV nodes in the finger offset only take one input, should be converted to MDL nodes.
