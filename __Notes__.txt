Notes for changes from uses of these tools in practical application and day-to-day use.
-----------------------------------------------------

LimbBuilderTool:
----------------
- Age old twist joint issue solved!: http://charactersetup.com/tutorial_rollJoints.html
  - Update the auto-rig functions to work based on this technique, adding an MDIV to adjust twist sensitivity

RenamerLibrary:
---------------
- Still has issues with renaming on repeat objects, not causing long-name issues.  Do tests before finalizing anything else.
- Suffix adding only affects first selection?

CurveAssignment:
----------------
- Widget forces a selected = cmds.ls(sl=True)[0] when nothing might be selected.  Change to a try/except that leaves selected = None if it fails.
- Widget does not create unique controller when Create Control is clicked, forces a selection
- Widget hierarchy list of offsets needs an 'X' button to remove unwanted parts.
  - Also seems to be mostly broken, performing the operation 3 times? (might be related to number of hierarchy groups)
  - ***Subclass the operation to allow for easier widget manipulation and isolated methods
- Widget correctly snaps to selection, but does not iterate over full list if more than one object is selected.
- Widget should have an overrideName checkbox as an option.
- New Curve types:
  - double/2-sided arrow
- add_curve_shape should be renamed and repurposed
  - if no transform node is given, create one itself

AttributeManipulation:
----------------------
- min/max values should be open to accepting None values.  Skip incorrect conditions in function, accept noneTypes in class.
- Warning about repeat attribute names is effective and gave good advice.  To improve, make a popup warning/error window class, then add a button that offers opening the channel control.
- add keyable (attribute) checkbox to widget
- create a preset library file for attribute widget to reference for faster assignment of common attributes
  - can also have an option to save to a temp file for current project and/or save to library file for permanent additions

CreateNodeLibrary:
------------------
- Add 'composeMatrix' to node options and widget
- Custom double to double3 node
  - Converts single input to a triple output (parented under single attr) [pxrToFloat3 node as reference]
  - Create script node, have backup that is just attrs added onto a unitConversion node (to avoid 'unknown' as type)

BasicTools:
-----------
- Create offset tool that makes sense in the context of joint orientation (very specific usage)
  - Would take in the direct orientation values AND the joint orient values and create an offset based exactly on direct orientation without calculating the joint orientation.  This is important for joints as the joints will maintain their joint orient values when placed in an offset group, this would help.
  - A checkbox labeled 'Maintain Joint Orientation' should suffice.

UniqueTools:
------------
- Smart node duplicator that search + replaces all nodes in a hierarchy
- Create a gui/dock add-on that can display the live attributes of input/selected objects.
  - Goal of this is to be able to evaluate what is changed by certain attributes
  - Work example: Switching between IKFK, and there's influence rotation when everything should be 0.  I want to see the values being affected without having to flip between the node editor or create keys just to live eval the numbers.
- Create button that takes a selected attribute from the channelbox and instantly displays input/outputs of it in the node editor
- Isolate Selection (Menu?):
  - Stores expected selection (quicker flashing on/off without selection highlighting and re-selection)
  - Replaces add/removeISO buttons on shelf
  - Option to store multiple selection sets to flip between isolated selections (less need for numerous camera panels)
- Isolate types:
  - In previous tab menu, add checkboxes of commonly adjusted viewport view items (ex. Polygons, NURBS, IKhandles, etc.)

Splitter:
---------
- The dock gui issue of crushing the widget/splitter texts is likely due to the Splitter class not having a fixed height equal to the height of the text.  On resizing, the splitter line remains in tact.

Pop-up Class:
-------------
- Create a pop-up window for warnings and errors that most users would not notice otherwise
- Can handle additional features such as a command-writable button that will run the suggested fix or work-around

Basic Rig Setup:
----------------
- Has been cleaned up to work with existing modules
- Should be implemented into dock, and cleaned up again in more efficient ways

Others:
-------
- Build custom node to class assignment system (or adapt pymel)
- Create assorted os/sys related commands to improve file-based work.  (Likely don't use a translator file, good practice not to)
- Create new translator file for general python utility extensions
  - ex. random functions (random.randint()), math functions, re functions (regex), etc.
- Long Term Goal: Create translator/wrapper file for Qt functions.  
- Create a bake transforms up function
  - takes the transform values of a node and 0s them out, moving the values up to its parent
  - good for late-term offsetting/changing values
- Have a function that can build custom buttons onto the dock per session
  - Should also have option to export the button layout/commands to be reloaded if desired


NOTES ADDRESSED ON 12/18/2018:
------------------------------

RenamerLibrary:
---------------
- Fails on all counts to change names if there is a duplicate name anywhere in the scene.  Probably needs to evaluate based on long names (cmds.ls(long=True)).
- Regex for find/replace does not accept numbers, enough application suggests it should take them.
- Suffix remove (and like prefix and other related bits) will repeat iterate when removing a suffix.  (ie. '*_CND_CND' becomes '*').  Try changing it to using .endswith('<input>') instead and see if that doesn't over iterate the issue.


CurveAssignment:
----------------
- Assign color on the tooldock (and likely general calls) only assigns color to the first selected object.  Should take all selected.
- Despite previous debate, orange preset in dock is too far to a red-orange.  Refer to the old curve tool for orange values, but keep red-orange in library as its distinction is still appealing and stands out.
- Assign color on the tooldock (and likely general calls) fails if the shortname of a shape node is not unique in the scene.  Likely needs a similar fix as the renamerLibrary longname fixes.


AttributeManipulation:
----------------------
- dock attr creator should have an option for keyable/non-keyable attributes (checkbox).
- dock attr creator does not have a bool attribute option.
- dock attr fails if nothing is put in the min/max boxes.  Reads as '' when it only takes int or None.  Needs fix in function and set the values in the Widget to "try" methods excepting ValueErrors.
- dock attr creator should have a clear index options button for the enum setup.


NodeLibrary(?):
---------------
- Build some matrix setups?  Immediate helper would involve a matrix setup that can cleanly setup space switches (fuck constraints).
  - Account for controller scaling and double transforms when using world/local values mixed with positions to avoid double transforms
    - Will require parent/world inverse matrices (similar to constraints without logic cycles)
- Change node_dictionary clamp node input to 'CLMP', otherwise node_name_dictionary will give it the wrong argument.
- Add multMatrix to library


FingerRigTool:
--------------
- Some of the MDIV nodes in the finger offset only take one input, should be converted to MDL nodes.
