Notes for changes from uses of these tools in practical application and day-to-day use.
-----------------------------------------------------

RenamerLibrary:
---------------
- Fails on all counts to change names if there is a duplicate name anywhere in the scene.  Probably needs to evaluate based on long names (cmds.ls(long=True))


CurveAssignment:
----------------
- Assign color on the tooldock (and likely general calls) only assigns color to the first selected object.  Should take all selected.


AttributeManipulation:
----------------------
- dock attr creator should have an option for keyable/non-keyable attributes (checkbox)
